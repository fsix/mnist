  "body": "# Introduction\r\n\r\nMNIST is the \"gateway drug\" of ML for Computer Vision. A dataset of handwritten digits published in the 1990s, MNIST is perhaps one of the most iconic exercises for beginning Machine Learning, and a milestone in using computers to structurally analyse images. Perhaps, in some day and age, you implemented regression or neural networks on this dataset. This guide will serve as an exploration of the MNIST dataset, beginning with simple methods and eventually reaching methods that will reach 99% accuracy.\r\n\r\n## Preprocessing Techniques\r\n\r\n## Optimizing Hyperparameters\r\n\r\n## Adverserial Training\r\n\r\n## Guiding Approximations",
